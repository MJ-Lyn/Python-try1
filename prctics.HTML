<h3>Before You Go Lyrics</h3>
<p>I fell by the wayside like everyone else
<br>I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
<br>But I was just kidding myself
<br>Our every moment, I start to replace
<br>'Cause now that they're gone
<br>All I hear are the words that I needed to say

<br><br>When you hurt under the surface
<br>Like troubled water running cold
<br>Well, time can heal but this won't

<br><br>So, before you go
<br>Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
<br>If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
<br>So, before you go
<br>Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
<br>It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
<br>So, before you go</p>
